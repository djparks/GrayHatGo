# Gray Hat Go - Part 1

## Qualifiers

1. I'm not a professional Go developer.

2. Do not blindly run the code. Trust but verify.

3. Do not run programs against environments you do not own.

4. It is your fault if you do not follow the aforementioned recommendations or use the code in an unethical manner.

5. Feel free to ask questions.

## Why use Go for security focused tasks

1. Go is simple, user-friendly, compared to other statically typed languages.

2. Go performs more optimally compared to dynamically typed langagues.

3. Go is designed for multicore environments.

4. Go has a clean, integrated package managment system.

5. Is is easy to cross-complile Go programs.

6. Go has a rich standard library.

7. Go programs are easily distributed since Go programs are built into a static binary.

## Why Go may not be great for security focused tasks

1. Go binaries are huge compared to binaries for C/C++.

2. Go is more verbose, less compact compared to languages like Python, Ruby.

3. Go is still a relatively new language (2009).
